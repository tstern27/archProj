### 4610 Computer Architecture Project ###

## About ##
This was a project that I completed while at UNT that focused on cache replacement policies.

I implemeted a: 
- FILO (First In Last Out)
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- MRU (Most Recently Used)
- Random

unfortunately due to COVID-19 we were never able to fully complete our project and our simulated data was nonsensical
